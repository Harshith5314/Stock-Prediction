# Stock Market Prediction using LSTM Models

This project leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to predict stock market prices. LSTMs are particularly well-suited for time series forecasting due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies and patterns in sequential data.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide accurate predictions of stock prices based on historical data. The LSTM model is trained on past stock prices and other relevant features to forecast future prices.

## Features

- **Data Collection:** Historical stock price data is collected from reliable financial sources.
- **Data Preprocessing:** The data is cleaned, normalized, and split into training and testing sets.
- **Model Architecture:** The LSTM model is designed to handle the temporal dependencies in stock price data.
- **Training:** The model is trained on the historical data with a focus on minimizing prediction errors.
- **Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using standard metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Prediction:** The trained model is used to predict future stock prices, and the results are visualized for analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for the project.
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** Deep learning frameworks used to build and train the LSTM model.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For data visualization.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Harshith5314/Stock-Prediction.git
cd stock-market-prediction-lstm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Ensure you have the necessary historical stock price data in CSV format.
   - Update the data file path in the script.

2. **Training the Model:**
   - Run the training script to train the LSTM model on your data.
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. **Making Predictions:**
   - Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```

## Results

The model's predictions are visualized to compare them with the actual stock prices. The visualization helps in understanding the model's accuracy and identifying areas for improvement.
